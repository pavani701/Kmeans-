# Kmeans Clustering Project 
# Project Title:
## Analysis and prediction of "Mall_Customers.csv" of american mall markets called as Phonix Mall to find out how many customers are visited to a particular a shop .On the basis of these prediction of anual income vs spending score .

# Disclimer:
## In these particular data set we assume annual income as a a centriod and spending score from the range 1-100 called as data nodes of the cluster.

# Problem Statement:
## The american finanace market as per the GDP of 2011 'phoex_trillums Mall' as in the first range out of five.The owner of mall is wants be exact which particluar shop all product search in different kind of clusters in entire mall.
## As a data science engineer predict futurestic financial market for upcoming GDP rate based on number of clusters. The client wants atlear top five clusters(shops).

# **Conclusion:** According to the model basics prediction using manchine algorithm KMeans clustering we found that cluster 1 which consists red color is a highest cluster which attach more than 50 data nodes.

# Refrences:The model building algorithm develop for all kinds of clusterations values.The yellow spots represents centriods which is max to max only 3.
